# ViSCAXA

ViSCAXA is a middleware software written in Go that transforms any API for chatbots or AI chats into a format that can be used under our frontend (ViSCAXA Android - ViSCAXA Web - ViSCAXA iOS). It allows for easy integration with various APIs and provides seamless communication between the backend and frontend.

1. Install Go and Electron
2. Run the `go run main.go` command in your terminal to start the middleware
3. Run the `npm start` command in another terminal to start the frontend
